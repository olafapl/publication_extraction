# CNN-Sentence

Tensorflow/Keras implementation of a CNN for sentence classification, based on the paper ["
Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) by Yoon
Kim.

This model uses pretrained GloVe word embeddings, and is trained on the [HomePub
dataset](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/zr/data/homepub.html). [This article](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/pretrained_word_embeddings/) from the Keras docs
was helpful for getting started with the GloVe embeddings.
